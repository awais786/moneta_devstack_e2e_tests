// Smoke test for the bypass + SSO-surface routers added in the 2026-05
// production rollout (foss-server-bundle#30). The PR chained
// `security-headers` and `strip-auth-headers` onto every browser-reachable
// non-secure router.
//
// What this test ACTUALLY proves: the bypass routers are reachable,
// fire on the documented paths, and don't 5xx — i.e. the router config
// itself is healthy after the rollout.
//
// What this test does NOT prove: that `strip-auth-headers` ran before
// the upstream. None of the bypass paths exercised here
// (`/favicon.ico`, `/god-mode`) currently read `X-Auth-Request-*`, so
// strip presence is unobservable from outside the stack. The actual
// strip-middleware validation lives in
// `tests/security/header-spoofing.spec.ts` ("strip middleware (authed)"),
// which targets a `*-secure` upstream that DOES read identity. We
// leave the spoofed-header values in this test as documentation: if
// a future bypass surface starts reading identity, this test grows
// teeth without further changes (just swap `/favicon.ico` for the new
// path and add an assertion on the response body).
//
// RULES.md §1 ("Bypass discipline") rule "strip in front of any
// browser-reachable upstream" remains an audit invariant; the live
// validation is in header-spoofing.spec.ts.
